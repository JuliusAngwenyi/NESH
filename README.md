# Introduction

NESH will equip the elderly peoples homes with a set of sensors that will monitor them non-intrusively (for example without using cameras). The sensors will allow their relatives or social carers know whether they have got out of bed, they have taken medication and have taken a hot drink for example. The list could span most areas in the home, including bathroom, watching TV, used the fridge, among others.

The data from these sensors will be collected centrally using Azure IoT services suite. The data can be accessed remotely by social care services or relatives. The data can also be shared with family doctor or hospital trust

NESH will complement and not replace the social care for the elderly by letting our senior citizens enjoy their day to day chores non-intrusively and significantly reduce the cost social workers services.
